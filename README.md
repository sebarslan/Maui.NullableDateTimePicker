# Maui Nullable and Clearable DateTimePicker
The Nullable DateTimePicker is a custom calendar control for selecting a nullable date and time value in a .NET MAUI application. It provides a consistent and platform-independent user interface for selecting dates, and allows the user to clear the value if needed.


This control uses the

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/badge/nuget-v3.1.2-blue.svg?style=plastic)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sebarslan.Maui.NullableDateTimePicker)


# Usage
To use the Nullable DateTimePicker control in your .NET MAUI application, follow these steps:

0- Add the Sebarslan.Maui.NullableDateTimePicker nuget package to your project and add the .ConfigureNullableDateTimePicker() element to the MauiProgram.cs file in your project.

<pre>
<code>
public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
{
    var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder()
    .UseMauiApp&lt;App&gt;()
    .ConfigureNullableDateTimePicker()
    ....
</code>
</pre>

### Usage 1: Use DateTimePicker as ContentView control (With input field and icon)
1- Add the NullableDateTimePicker control to your XAML layout file:

xmlns:ndtp="clr-namespace:Maui.NullableDateTimePicker;assembly=Maui.NullableDateTimePicker"
<pre>
<code>
&lt;ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             xmlns:ndtp="clr-namespace:Maui.NullableDateTimePicker;assembly=Maui.NullableDateTimePicker"
             x:Class="Maui.NullableDateTimePicker.Samples.MainPage"&gt;
</code>
</pre>

2- And add the following code to the place where you want to use DateTimePicker and then connect the SelectedDateTime property with the Datetime Property in your ViewModel.
<pre>
<code>
&lt;ndtp:NullableDateTimePicker SelectedDateTime="{Binding MyDateTime}" Mode="Date" /&gt;
</code>
</pre>


### Usage 2: Use direct calendar popup with your own entry and button

1- Add your entry and button for datetime in your xaml page (eg. MainPage.xaml)
<pre>
<code>
&lt;HorizontalStackLayout HorizontalOptions="Fill"  HeightRequest="40"&gt;
    &lt;Entry x:Name="DateTimeEntry" Text="{Binding MyDateTime, StringFormat='{0:g}'}" 
    HorizontalOptions="Fill"
    VerticalOptions="Fill"
    IsReadOnly="True" /&gt;
    &lt;ImageButton Source="{Binding CalendarIcon}" 
    Clicked="DateTimePicker_Clicked"
    Margin="0"
    Padding="2"
    WidthRequest="30" /&gt;
&lt;/HorizontalStackLayout&gt;
 </code>
</pre>  

2- Then, when you click on the button or entry, define the options and call NullableDateTimePicker.OpenAsync(options) to open the calendar in your xaml.cs file. (eg. MainPage.xaml.cs)
<pre>
<code>
private async void DateTimePicker_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    INullableDateTimePickerOptions nullableDateTimePickerOptions = new NullableDateTimePickerOptions
    {
        SelectedDateTime = MyDateTime,
        Mode = PickerModes.DateTime,
        ShowWeekNumbers = true
        // .. other picker options
    };

    var result = await NullableDateTimePicker.OpenAsync(nullableDateTimePickerOptions);
    if (result is PopupResult popupResult && popupResult.ButtonResult != PopupButtons.Cancel)
    {
        MyDateTime = popupResult.SelectedDateTime;
        // DateTimeEntry.Text = popupResult.SelectedDateTime?.ToString("g"); //If you are not using ViewModel
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

## SelectedDateTimeTimeChanged Event (If NullableDateTimePicker is used as ContentView)
The SelectedDateTimeChanged event is used to indicate when a SelectedDateTime value has been changed. 
This event is commonly used in programming or software environments and is triggered when the SelectedDateTime value is modified.

The event utilizes the DateTimeChangedEventArgs class as its argument. The DateTimeChangedEventArgs class contains additional information that is carried at the moment the event is triggered. It may include details about the date and time change, such as the old DateTime value and the new DateTime value.

Below is an example code snippet illustrating the usage of the "SelectedDateTimeChanged" event and the "DateTimeChangedEventArgs" argument class:
<pre>
<code>
NullableDateTimePicker dateTimePicker = new NullableDateTimePicker();
dateTimePicker.SelectedDateTimeChanged += OnSelectedDateTimeChanged;

private static void OnSelectedDateTimeChanged(object sender, DateTimeChangedEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("DateTime changed!");
    Console.WriteLine("Old DateTime: " + e.OldDateTime);
    Console.WriteLine("New DateTime: " + e.NewDateTime);
}
</code>
</pre>


> .NET MAUI handler was used in the test project to remove the underline in the original entry.
> Please refer to the MauiProgram.cs file in the sample project.
